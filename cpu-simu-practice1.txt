1.Write a conditional statement such that if R02 is greater than(>)R01 then R03 is set to 8. 

MOV #2 R01
MOV #10 R02
CMP R02 R01 // If R02 = R01 then the status flag Z will be set; if R01 > R02 then none of the status flags Z and N will be set; if R01 < R02 then the status flag N will be set.
JGT $MOV8  // If R01 < R02 then it will not jump. If R01>R02 then it will jump to lable MOV8
HLT
MOV8:
MOV #8 R03


2. Write a conditional statement such that if R02 is less than or equal to(<=)R01 then R03 is set to -5.(Use R01 as the first operand and R02 as the second operand)

MOV #13 R01
MOV #5 R02
CMP R01 R02
JLE $MOV8
HLT
MOV8:
MOV #-5 R03

3. Write a conditional statement such that if R01 = 0 then R03 is set to 5 elseR03 is set to R01 plus 1.

MOV #13 R01
CMP #0 R01
JEQ $MOV8
ADD #1 R01
MOV R01 R03
HLT
MOV8:
MOV #5 R03
HLT

4. Write a loop that repeats 5 timeswhere R02 is incremented by 2 every time the loop repeats.
MOV #0 R01
MOV #5 R02
MOV8:
ADD #2 R02
ADD #1 R01
CMP #5 R01
JNE MOV8
HLT
